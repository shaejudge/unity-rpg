Boss Man Text

Welcome.
Does this feel like de ja vu?  Trust me, it shouldn’t.
You look like the fighting type.  How's your memory?
Just relax.  You won’t have any regrets before too long.
I once made a rat attack a houseplant.
The human brain is fascinating.

Doctor: Look! It's your brother! He couldn't convince you to be our test subject, so I used him instead!!
Hero: Brother!
Doctor: You can't save him now!
Brother: ...

He's super dead.

Hero: Brother!
Brother: Hero, you saved me.
Hero: Are you alright?
Brother: I'm sorry...
Hero: For what?
Brother: I tried to get you to be our test subject, and when I failed, the doctor said that "reseach demands sacrifice" and he injected me with anesthesia.
Brother: ...I'm sorry.
Hero: All that matters is that you're safe. Let's get you out of this wretched place.
