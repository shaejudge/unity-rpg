Brother: Hero! Glad you are finally awake.
Hero: Hello Brother.
Brother: How are you feeling today?
Hero: Okay, I guess. Brother, what is it that you do in that lab?
Brother: That's classified. Unless of course, you've thought more about my offer to get you a job there?
Hero: I'm a lumberjack, not an scientist like you are.
Brother: Is that what you want to do for the rest of your life?
Hero: What do you mean? I like working with my hands.
Brother: But is that what you WANT.
Hero: It doesn't matter, that's what needs to be done in this town.
Brother: But I could give you a better life! A life of meaning, and purpose!! Not just cutting down trees in this stupid town.
Hero: I don't know what you do in that lab, but it's changed you. You used to appreciate the simple life.
Brother: We are trying to make people better! To perfect the human-
Hero: The human...Brother, tell me you aren't testing...
Brother: I've said too much. If you want to help our cause, take this key.
Hero: No. I won't have any part of your...experiments.
Brother: Fine! Have it your way! Be an idiotic lumberjack for the rest of your life. I don't have time for this.
